# Welcome to Realms - the lightweight Rust game library

Realms is a library that allows you to easily make games, animations and any 2D
or 3D graphics using Rust.

As of version `1.1.1`, Realms now uses OpenGL as a backend. This is a huge API
change, and most things have changed since `0.2.1`. Get up to date by
[reading the examples](https://github.com/dylanopen/realms/tree/main/examples).

## Documentation

For extensive documentation on specific fields, structs and functions, see the
documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/realms).

## Examples

You can find a list of examples for how to use Realms at
[github.com/dylanopen/realms/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/dylanopen/realms/tree/main/examples)

## Useful resources

Realms is based on OpenGL. For this reason, it is very helpful to have at
least some knowledge of the basics of OpenGL; in particular with vertex
buffers (VAOs, VBOs and EBOs/IBOs) and shaders in the GLSL programming language.

Below is a list of useful resources for learning OpenGL, the Realms library
APIs and game development in general:

- [Realms examples](https://github.com/dylanopen/realms/tree/main/examples)
- [Realms documentation (docs.rs)](https://docs.rs/realms)
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)
- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

Thanks for choosing Realms to build your next great game!
