# Welcome to Realms - the lightweight Rust game library

Realms is a library that allows you to easily make games, animations and any 2D
or 3D graphics using Rust.

As of version `1.1.1`, Realms now uses OpenGL as a backend. This is a huge API
change, and most things have changed since `0.2.1`. Get up to date by
[reading the examples](https://github.com/dylanopen/realms/tree/main/examples).

## Documentation
